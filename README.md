## About Me:

- I'm a CS graduate with an interest in software development and information security. 
- For now, my github account will be dedicated to hosting some past and current projects to show my coding style and abilities.
- Soon I hope to shift my focus toward contributing to various open source projects on the platform!
- I intend to create a new email specifically for people from here to contact me. When I do, I'll add it here.
